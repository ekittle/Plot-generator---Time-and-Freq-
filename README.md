# Plot-generator---Time-and-Freq-

Practice code that I've worked on to lean python. This code takes optically pumped magnetometer (OPM), EMG (electromyography), Aichi DJ (magneto-inductive), Aichi DH (magneto-inductive), and TDK (magneto-resistive) outputs sampled at 2k Hz and displays them in either time or frequency domains.
